**This is just an experiment!**

Experimenting with APIs for an authentication system and its relationship with [#594](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus/issues/594)

**Objective of this experiment is to:**

- Experiment with a nice and highly customizable user-facing API
- Provide OAuth integration (via [grant](https://github.com/simov/grant) package)
- Storing and retrieving user data via the database module (from [#594](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus/issues/594))
- JWT encoding/decoding (via [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken))

This is a second iteration of [@colyseus/social](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus-social) tried to achieve.
